How to build from nevergames repo


# Initial Project Setup
1) Clone the repository locally

2) Download the 1.59 version of Steamworks SDK.  It's available here:
https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list

3) Unzip the sdk folder into the root folder of this project (sdk/)


# Building the project (e.g. after making code changes)
1) Open the solution file (Facepunch.Steamworks.sln) in Visual Studio

2) In the toolbar select build > build solution

3) Navigate to the Facepunch.Steamworks\bin\Debug\net46 folder

4) Manually copy all Facepunch.Steamworks.* files into UnityPlugin.  These should overwrite the existing files there.
* Note: Do NOT copy steam_api.dll or steam_api64.dll

5) You can ignore the rest of the instructions here as they've already been setup for you.  However, I'm leaving them in for reference.

6) Install or update this repo in your main repo (e.g. FinalFactory).  You should use the following git url in your project's package manager:
https://github.com/Final-Factory/Facepunch.Steamworks.git?path=/UnityPlugin


## Updating SDK versions

1) Download the latest Steamworks SDK that Facepunch.Steamworks is compatible with.  It's available for download here:
https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list

2) Unzip the sdk folder into the root folder of this project (sdk/)

3) Follow the instructions to build the project (above)

4) Copy the files from sdk/redistributable_bin intoUnityPlugin/redistributable_bin.  This should overwrite the existing files there.
Note: Ensure you just overwrite files--don't delete the folder and recreate.  You need the existing .meta files in there for Unity.


# Original Facepunch instructions to update Unity files (already done if you're using the customized repo)

The last step is to set the .dll files to have the correct settings. Follow these steps in Unity now that you've copied the files over:

    Facepunch.Steamworks.Posix.dll:
        Any Platform: Unchecked
        Include Platforms: Editor, Standalone
        Platform Settings:
            CPU: Any
            OS: OSX
            Switch tabs:
                Windows: all unchecked
                Linux and OSX: all checked

    Facepunch.Steamworks.Win32.dll:
        Any Platform: Checked
        Include Platforms: Both Unchecked
        Platform Settings:
            CPU: x86
            OS: Windows
            Switch tabs:
                Windows: check x86
                everything else: Unchecked

    Facepunch.Steamworks.Win64.dll:
        Any Platform: Checked
        Include Platforms: Both Unchecked
        Platform Settings:
            CPU: x86_64
            OS: Windows
            Switch tabs:
                Windows: check x86_64
                Linux and OSX: Unchecked


File Placement

Grab the latest version from the Release Page. Download the Facepunch.Steamworks file - not the source.

Inside there's a UnityPlugin folder. Extract that to your project folder.



Unity Config

We have included the Unity .meta files in the zip file, so everything should be set up. The dlls should be assigned to the right platforms and should copy the dlls to the right locations on build.
Initializing

To start up you just call Steamworks.SteamClient.Init with your appid. If it can't initialize it'll throw an exception - so make sure you catch that and deal with it.
try
{
	Steamworks.SteamClient.Init( 252490 );
}
catch ( System.Exception e )
{
	// Something went wrong - it's one of these:
    //
    //     Steam is closed?
    //     Can't find steam_api dll?
    //     Don't have permission to play app?
    //
}


WARNING:
You should only call this once on startup. Structure your code so this happens in your initialization code.
